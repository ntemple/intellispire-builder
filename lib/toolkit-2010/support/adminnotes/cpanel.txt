A: There are a couple of possibilities. The date on your server could be improperly synced, your main IP could have changed, or your files could have been corrupted.

   1.

      First, try to resync your server's date:

      #rdate -s rdate.darkorb.net
   2.

      If that does not work, try to update your CPanel license file:

      #/usr/local/cpanel/cpkeyclt
   3.

      If these do not work contact your distributor so they can update your license
