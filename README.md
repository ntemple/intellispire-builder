#intelispire-builder

This is the system developed to be able to take:
- a plugin template / framework
- an integration class

and spit out a completed plugin.

Documentation is thin and this hasn't been updated in 4 years. Your mileage will vary.

For example, we support "platforms"
* Joomla Component
* Joomla Plugin
* Wordpress

And Integrations
* iContect
* ConstantContect
* Aweber
- etc

This build system will take the above integrations and create a plugin, component, and Joomla plugin from each.

The system is currently unsupported, though I'll accept patches.
